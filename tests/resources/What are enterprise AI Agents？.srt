00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
AI agents are here for enterprises, and they hold massive potential.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,400
These tools that can reason, decide, and act are the talk of companies everywhere.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,820
But getting agents to production is still too hard.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,480
Why aren't agents everywhere?

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,680
It's because enterprise AI agents are hard to get right.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,440
Many of them just don't work.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,560
And the ones that do?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,220
They're not always accurate.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,880
They force choices and don't let you choose the best combination of models for the job.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,880
And they create risk, forcing you to send your critical data to external AI models.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,040
That's why thousands of organizations around the globe have partnered with Databricks to

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,460
adopt a different approach.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,200
At Databricks, we've pioneered a better way to build enterprise AI agents,

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,440
tailoring them automatically to your data and use case to provide real value.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,280
Banks are using multi-agent systems to securely review investment theses and generate investment

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,180
memos, saving 200,000 man-hours and generating $250 million in value.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,220
In energy, teams are combining real-time grid, meter, and weather data to predict potential

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,660
disruptions and restore power 25% faster for customers, saving $18 million in annual outage costs.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,960
And in healthcare and life sciences, they're predicting how drug molecules impact gene

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,020
expression, accelerating the understanding of disease biology to design new cures.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,160
Databricks gives you the highest accuracy by using research-backed techniques to measure

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,680
and tune agents that continuously improve without needing to be rebuilt.

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,820
So you can get more agents to production and have more success with AI.
