00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What's going on everybody? Welcome back

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's going on everybody? Welcome back to another video. Today we're going to

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
to another video. Today we're going to

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to another video. Today we're going to be talking about IDP and data [music]

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
be talking about IDP and data [music]

6
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
be talking about IDP and data [music] bricks.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, as a data analyst, I spend a lot of

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, as a data analyst, I spend a lot of my time on data collection. So, that's

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
my time on data collection. So, that's

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
my time on data collection. So, that's going to be getting the data into a

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
going to be getting the data into a

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to be getting the data into a usable format for other teams. And a lot

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
usable format for other teams. And a lot

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
usable format for other teams. And a lot of the times it's just in a CSV or it's

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of the times it's just in a CSV or it's

16
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of the times it's just in a CSV or it's in a database. It's really easy to use,

17
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in a database. It's really easy to use,

18
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in a database. It's really easy to use, but it isn't always the case. In fact, a

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but it isn't always the case. In fact, a

20
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but it isn't always the case. In fact, a lot of the data that I used to work with

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
lot of the data that I used to work with

22
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
lot of the data that I used to work with was in unstructured formats.

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
was in unstructured formats.

24
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
was in unstructured formats. Specifically, this was in healthcare

25
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Specifically, this was in healthcare

26
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Specifically, this was in healthcare when we were working directly with

27
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
when we were working directly with

28
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
when we were working directly with hospitals. And so, we would get doctor's

29
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
hospitals. And so, we would get doctor's

30
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
hospitals. And so, we would get doctor's notes, we would get clinician notes, we

31
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
notes, we would get clinician notes, we

32
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
notes, we would get clinician notes, we would get claims documents, and that

33
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
would get claims documents, and that

34
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
would get claims documents, and that data is not formatted in columns and

35
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
data is not formatted in columns and

36
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
data is not formatted in columns and rows. It's just free text. And I'm old

37
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
rows. It's just free text. And I'm old

38
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
rows. It's just free text. And I'm old enough to remember we would use OCR to

39
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
enough to remember we would use OCR to

40
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
enough to remember we would use OCR to extract all this data and make it usable

41
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
extract all this data and make it usable

42
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
extract all this data and make it usable and put it into columns and rows. That

43
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and put it into columns and rows. That

44
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and put it into columns and rows. That process was very difficult, filled with

45
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
process was very difficult, filled with

46
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
process was very difficult, filled with a ton of rules and things that would

47
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a ton of rules and things that would

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
a ton of rules and things that would break down a lot, but I don't think

49
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
break down a lot, but I don't think

50
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
break down a lot, but I don't think that's the way that you should be doing

51
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that's the way that you should be doing

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that's the way that you should be doing it anymore. In fact, I've been using IDP

53
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
it anymore. In fact, I've been using IDP

54
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
it anymore. In fact, I've been using IDP in data bricks and it is amazing. So,

55
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
in data bricks and it is amazing. So,

56
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
in data bricks and it is amazing. So, let's dive into IDP and see what it is

57
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
let's dive into IDP and see what it is

58
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
let's dive into IDP and see what it is and why it is so useful. The first thing

59
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and why it is so useful. The first thing

60
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and why it is so useful. The first thing to look at is just what IDP actually is.

61
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to look at is just what IDP actually is.

62
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to look at is just what IDP actually is. It stands for intelligent document

63
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It stands for intelligent document

64
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It stands for intelligent document processing. It just uses AI to extract

65
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
processing. It just uses AI to extract

66
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
processing. It just uses AI to extract data and information from your

67
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
data and information from your

68
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
data and information from your documents. And I'm sure a lot of you

69
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
documents. And I'm sure a lot of you

70
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
documents. And I'm sure a lot of you guys have actually tried this at some

71
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
guys have actually tried this at some

72
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
guys have actually tried this at some point. You just pop it into Chat GBT.

73
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
point. You just pop it into Chat GBT.

74
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
point. You just pop it into Chat GBT. You say, "Hey, tell me what this

75
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You say, "Hey, tell me what this

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You say, "Hey, tell me what this document says." And it gives you kind of

77
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
document says." And it gives you kind of

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
document says." And it gives you kind of a right answer. I've done that myself.

79
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a right answer. I've done that myself.

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
a right answer. I've done that myself. And for the most part, it's okay, but

81
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And for the most part, it's okay, but

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And for the most part, it's okay, but it's not amazing. You can even see here

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it's not amazing. You can even see here

84
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
it's not amazing. You can even see here on the lefth hand side, this is a

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
on the lefth hand side, this is a

86
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
on the lefth hand side, this is a benchmark test for this type of process.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
benchmark test for this type of process.

88
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
benchmark test for this type of process. This is going to be accuracy versus

89
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is going to be accuracy versus

90
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is going to be accuracy versus pricing. And you can see cha JBT way on

91
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
pricing. And you can see cha JBT way on

92
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
pricing. And you can see cha JBT way on the right hand side. It's going to be

93
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the right hand side. It's going to be

94
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the right hand side. It's going to be quite expensive for just okay accuracy

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
quite expensive for just okay accuracy

96
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
quite expensive for just okay accuracy right around 76 77%. You'll notice

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
right around 76 77%. You'll notice

98
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
right around 76 77%. You'll notice though data bricks is in the top left

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
though data bricks is in the top left

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
though data bricks is in the top left which is kind of exactly where you want

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
which is kind of exactly where you want

102
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which is kind of exactly where you want to be. You want it to be the most

103
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to be. You want it to be the most

104
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to be. You want it to be the most accurate for the lowest price and data

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
accurate for the lowest price and data

106
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
accurate for the lowest price and data bicks does that. Now why does IDP matter

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
bicks does that. Now why does IDP matter

108
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
bicks does that. Now why does IDP matter at all? And this goes back to the exact

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
at all? And this goes back to the exact

110
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
at all? And this goes back to the exact thing I was talking about at the very

111
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
thing I was talking about at the very

112
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
thing I was talking about at the very beginning, which is a lot of data is not

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
beginning, which is a lot of data is not

114
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
beginning, which is a lot of data is not actually stored in databases and columns

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
actually stored in databases and columns

116
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
actually stored in databases and columns and rows. It's just free text. It's

117
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and rows. It's just free text. It's

118
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and rows. It's just free text. It's unstructured data. There is a ton of

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
unstructured data. There is a ton of

120
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
unstructured data. There is a ton of really important data in these

121
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
really important data in these

122
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
really important data in these unstructured data types and just these

123
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
unstructured data types and just these

124
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
unstructured data types and just these free text and documents that are sitting

125
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
free text and documents that are sitting

126
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
free text and documents that are sitting out there that people want to be able to

127
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
out there that people want to be able to

128
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
out there that people want to be able to use, but they just can't in its current

129
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
use, but they just can't in its current

130
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
use, but they just can't in its current state. Something that makes IDP really

131
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
state. Something that makes IDP really

132
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
state. Something that makes IDP really useful is that it is taking into context

133
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
useful is that it is taking into context

134
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
useful is that it is taking into context the document that you're processing. So,

135
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the document that you're processing. So,

136
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the document that you're processing. So, it isn't fully rules-based, which OCR

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
it isn't fully rules-based, which OCR

138
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it isn't fully rules-based, which OCR pretty much was. When I was back on my

139
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
pretty much was. When I was back on my

140
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
pretty much was. When I was back on my data collection team, we had a lot of

141
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
data collection team, we had a lot of

142
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
data collection team, we had a lot of pipelines that had OCR in it. And I

143
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
pipelines that had OCR in it. And I

144
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
pipelines that had OCR in it. And I would say at least once a week, they

145
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
would say at least once a week, they

146
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
would say at least once a week, they would break. They would just break down

147
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
would break. They would just break down

148
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
would break. They would just break down because the structure changed or

149
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because the structure changed or

150
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because the structure changed or something changed in the documents or

151
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
something changed in the documents or

152
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
something changed in the documents or the document file type changed. It just

153
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the document file type changed. It just

154
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the document file type changed. It just would happen all the time. This is what

155
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
would happen all the time. This is what

156
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
would happen all the time. This is what makes IDP really powerful because it

157
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
makes IDP really powerful because it

158
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
makes IDP really powerful because it isn't completely rules-based like OCR

159
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
isn't completely rules-based like OCR

160
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
isn't completely rules-based like OCR was because if anything changed within

161
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
was because if anything changed within

162
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
was because if anything changed within that document, it just broke. it just

163
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that document, it just broke. it just

164
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that document, it just broke. it just immediately stopped working and it was

165
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
immediately stopped working and it was

166
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
immediately stopped working and it was horrible and we had to fix things all

167
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
horrible and we had to fix things all

168
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
horrible and we had to fix things all the time. But with IDP, it's really

169
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the time. But with IDP, it's really

170
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the time. But with IDP, it's really flexible to the document that you're

171
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
flexible to the document that you're

172
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
flexible to the document that you're actually using. For example, on this

173
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
actually using. For example, on this

174
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
actually using. For example, on this right hand side, this is just a PDF

175
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
right hand side, this is just a PDF

176
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
right hand side, this is just a PDF document. This is some image that

177
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
document. This is some image that

178
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
document. This is some image that somebody put out there, but it isn't

179
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
somebody put out there, but it isn't

180
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
somebody put out there, but it isn't sitting in columns and rows. There's

181
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
sitting in columns and rows. There's

182
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
sitting in columns and rows. There's free text on the lefthand side. There's

183
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
free text on the lefthand side. There's

184
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
free text on the lefthand side. There's columns and rows on the right hand side.

185
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
columns and rows on the right hand side.

186
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
columns and rows on the right hand side. Now, this data might be really useful

187
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now, this data might be really useful

188
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now, this data might be really useful that you want to extract even the data

189
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that you want to extract even the data

190
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that you want to extract even the data in the free text on the lefth hand side.

191
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in the free text on the lefth hand side.

192
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
in the free text on the lefth hand side. With IDP, you'll be able to write pretty

193
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
With IDP, you'll be able to write pretty

194
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
With IDP, you'll be able to write pretty simple code to extract the data in the

195
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
simple code to extract the data in the

196
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
simple code to extract the data in the free text. And it's very easy to extract

197
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
free text. And it's very easy to extract

198
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
free text. And it's very easy to extract the data on the right hand side. And if

199
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the data on the right hand side. And if

200
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the data on the right hand side. And if things change, maybe they flip sides or

201
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
things change, maybe they flip sides or

202
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
things change, maybe they flip sides or more data is added or there's more free

203
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
more data is added or there's more free

204
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
more data is added or there's more free text on the lefth hand side, it's still

205
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
text on the lefth hand side, it's still

206
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
text on the lefth hand side, it's still going to be really flexible with that

207
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
going to be really flexible with that

208
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
going to be really flexible with that data type. And in future lessons, we are

209
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
data type. And in future lessons, we are

210
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
data type. And in future lessons, we are going to deep dive into this. I'm going

211
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
going to deep dive into this. I'm going

212
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
going to deep dive into this. I'm going to actually show you how to extract data

213
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
to actually show you how to extract data

214
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to actually show you how to extract data just like this. So, let's take a look at

215
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
just like this. So, let's take a look at

216
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
just like this. So, let's take a look at the difference between traditional

217
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the difference between traditional

218
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the difference between traditional processing and IDP. Now, traditional

219
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
processing and IDP. Now, traditional

220
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
processing and IDP. Now, traditional processing is the one that I kind of

221
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
processing is the one that I kind of

222
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
processing is the one that I kind of grew up with or the one that I've used

223
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
grew up with or the one that I've used

224
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
grew up with or the one that I've used the most because this is just what we

225
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the most because this is just what we

226
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the most because this is just what we had when we were doing this type of

227
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
had when we were doing this type of

228
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
had when we were doing this type of work. This is going to be using OCR,

229
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
work. This is going to be using OCR,

230
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
work. This is going to be using OCR, which stands for optical character

231
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which stands for optical character

232
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which stands for optical character recognition. This is what I used and

233
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
recognition. This is what I used and

234
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
recognition. This is what I used and basically everybody else used for

235
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
basically everybody else used for

236
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
basically everybody else used for unstructured data. And you would set

237
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
unstructured data. And you would set

238
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
unstructured data. And you would set custom rules for each document that you

239
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
custom rules for each document that you

240
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
custom rules for each document that you were working with. There were so many

241
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
were working with. There were so many

242
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
were working with. There were so many different tools and templates that you

243
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
different tools and templates that you

244
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
different tools and templates that you can use, and those were really helpful.

245
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
can use, and those were really helpful.

246
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
can use, and those were really helpful. But again, things would break fairly

247
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But again, things would break fairly

248
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But again, things would break fairly easily, and so it was a lot of

249
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
easily, and so it was a lot of

250
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
easily, and so it was a lot of maintenance to actually keep up with

251
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
maintenance to actually keep up with

252
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
maintenance to actually keep up with these pipelines. The most frustrating

253
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
these pipelines. The most frustrating

254
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
these pipelines. The most frustrating thing about using this was when a

255
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
thing about using this was when a

256
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
thing about using this was when a customer would not tell you that they're

257
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
customer would not tell you that they're

258
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
customer would not tell you that they're going to be changing a format to a PDF

259
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
going to be changing a format to a PDF

260
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
going to be changing a format to a PDF or whatever document they were sending

261
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
or whatever document they were sending

262
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
or whatever document they were sending you. They would just change it and you

263
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you. They would just change it and you

264
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you. They would just change it and you wouldn't find out until like a week

265
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
wouldn't find out until like a week

266
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
wouldn't find out until like a week later or 2 weeks later when the data

267
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
later or 2 weeks later when the data

268
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
later or 2 weeks later when the data just wasn't coming in anymore. Now, it

269
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
just wasn't coming in anymore. Now, it

270
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
just wasn't coming in anymore. Now, it was still worth maintaining. It was

271
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
was still worth maintaining. It was

272
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
was still worth maintaining. It was still worth using those OCR systems

273
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
still worth using those OCR systems

274
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
still worth using those OCR systems because we would get a lot of really

275
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
because we would get a lot of really

276
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
because we would get a lot of really good data out of it, but it wasn't 100%

277
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
good data out of it, but it wasn't 100%

278
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
good data out of it, but it wasn't 100% accurate. We had several data quality

279
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
accurate. We had several data quality

280
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
accurate. We had several data quality analysts who would be on our team who

281
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
analysts who would be on our team who

282
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
analysts who would be on our team who would manually check a lot of these

283
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
would manually check a lot of these

284
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
would manually check a lot of these things and run tons of queries and tons

285
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
things and run tons of queries and tons

286
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
things and run tons of queries and tons of code to make sure that the data is

287
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
of code to make sure that the data is

288
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
of code to make sure that the data is really accurate. Traditional processing

289
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
really accurate. Traditional processing

290
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
really accurate. Traditional processing with OCR is not a bad system. It's just

291
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
with OCR is not a bad system. It's just

292
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
with OCR is not a bad system. It's just a lot of work. Now with IDP, we're going

293
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a lot of work. Now with IDP, we're going

294
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
a lot of work. Now with IDP, we're going to be using an AI agent-based system. So

295
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to be using an AI agent-based system. So

296
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
to be using an AI agent-based system. So when it processes your document, it's

297
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
when it processes your document, it's

298
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
when it processes your document, it's going to understand the layout and the

299
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
going to understand the layout and the

300
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
going to understand the layout and the context of your document without you

301
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
context of your document without you

302
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
context of your document without you having to create the rules for it. One

303
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
having to create the rules for it. One

304
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
having to create the rules for it. One of the best things about this is just

305
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
of the best things about this is just

306
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
of the best things about this is just that it doesn't break very easily. It's

307
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that it doesn't break very easily. It's

308
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that it doesn't break very easily. It's really hard because it's so flexible.

309
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
really hard because it's so flexible.

310
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
really hard because it's so flexible. it's really hard to actually get it to

311
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
it's really hard to actually get it to

312
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's really hard to actually get it to break. So with traditional OCR, if you

313
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
break. So with traditional OCR, if you

314
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
break. So with traditional OCR, if you change it from a PDF into like a DOCX or

315
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
change it from a PDF into like a DOCX or

316
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
change it from a PDF into like a DOCX or just a Word document, it's going to

317
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
just a Word document, it's going to

318
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
just a Word document, it's going to break, right? It's looking for a

319
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
break, right? It's looking for a

320
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
break, right? It's looking for a specific file type. But with IDP, it's

321
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
specific file type. But with IDP, it's

322
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
specific file type. But with IDP, it's just going to really easily, flexibly

323
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
just going to really easily, flexibly

324
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
just going to really easily, flexibly change from one document type to

325
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
change from one document type to

326
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
change from one document type to another. IDP has a ton of built-in

327
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
another. IDP has a ton of built-in

328
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
another. IDP has a ton of built-in functions, and those are what we're

329
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
functions, and those are what we're

330
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
functions, and those are what we're going to be looking at in the next

331
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
going to be looking at in the next

332
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
going to be looking at in the next several lessons. They have a bunch of

333
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
several lessons. They have a bunch of

334
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
several lessons. They have a bunch of built-in functions that do a lot of the

335
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
built-in functions that do a lot of the

336
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
built-in functions that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. You basically

337
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
heavy lifting for you. You basically

338
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
heavy lifting for you. You basically just need to point at it. You need to

339
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
just need to point at it. You need to

340
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
just need to point at it. You need to say here's what you should be looking

341
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
say here's what you should be looking

342
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
say here's what you should be looking for and it's going to do most of the

343
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for and it's going to do most of the

344
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
for and it's going to do most of the work for you. So there aren't a ton of

345
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
work for you. So there aren't a ton of

346
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
work for you. So there aren't a ton of custom rules that you need to be

347
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
custom rules that you need to be

348
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
custom rules that you need to be creating. Now in just a second we're

349
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
creating. Now in just a second we're

350
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
creating. Now in just a second we're going to talk about how we actually use

351
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
going to talk about how we actually use

352
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
going to talk about how we actually use IDP in data bricks but this is just a

353
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
IDP in data bricks but this is just a

354
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
IDP in data bricks but this is just a visual for you to see kind of what it

355
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
visual for you to see kind of what it

356
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
visual for you to see kind of what it looks like for that transformation. It's

357
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
looks like for that transformation. It's

358
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
looks like for that transformation. It's super simplified but it can take a raw

359
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
super simplified but it can take a raw

360
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
super simplified but it can take a raw PDF and in that PDF it could be free

361
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
PDF and in that PDF it could be free

362
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
PDF and in that PDF it could be free text, it could be columns and rows.

363
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
text, it could be columns and rows.

364
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
text, it could be columns and rows. We'll look at both in the next lessons.

365
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We'll look at both in the next lessons.

366
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll look at both in the next lessons. But you're going to parse out that data.

367
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But you're going to parse out that data.

368
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But you're going to parse out that data. You're going to use the IDP process

369
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're going to use the IDP process

370
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're going to use the IDP process which we're going to look at in just a

371
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which we're going to look at in just a

372
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
which we're going to look at in just a sec. and it's going to put it into

373
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
sec. and it's going to put it into

374
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
sec. and it's going to put it into columns and rows to make that data

375
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
columns and rows to make that data

376
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
columns and rows to make that data usable. This is what I would say 95% of

377
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
usable. This is what I would say 95% of

378
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
usable. This is what I would say 95% of people want when they have these PDF

379
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
people want when they have these PDF

380
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
people want when they have these PDF documents that they want to use. They

381
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
documents that they want to use. They

382
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
documents that they want to use. They want to just have it in columns and rows

383
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
want to just have it in columns and rows

384
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
want to just have it in columns and rows that they can query off the data and

385
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that they can query off the data and

386
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that they can query off the data and they can actually use the data. And so

387
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
they can actually use the data. And so

388
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
they can actually use the data. And so how do you do that within data bricks? I

389
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
how do you do that within data bricks? I

390
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
how do you do that within data bricks? I had mentioned those AI functions and

391
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
had mentioned those AI functions and

392
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
had mentioned those AI functions and that's what you're going to use. You're

393
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that's what you're going to use. You're

394
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that's what you're going to use. You're going to use it for parsing, extracting

395
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
going to use it for parsing, extracting

396
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
going to use it for parsing, extracting and then classifying your data. If you

397
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and then classifying your data. If you

398
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and then classifying your data. If you know how to use those functions as well

399
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
know how to use those functions as well

400
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
know how to use those functions as well as just some basic SQL or Python because

401
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
as just some basic SQL or Python because

402
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
as just some basic SQL or Python because you can use either one, you can use IDP

403
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you can use either one, you can use IDP

404
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you can use either one, you can use IDP within data bricks to do this entire

405
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
within data bricks to do this entire

406
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
within data bricks to do this entire process. I personally like using SQL.

407
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
process. I personally like using SQL.

408
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
process. I personally like using SQL. That's what we're going to use in the

409
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's what we're going to use in the

410
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's what we're going to use in the next several lessons. But it's just as

411
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
next several lessons. But it's just as

412
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
next several lessons. But it's just as easy to use Python in the notebooks as

413
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
easy to use Python in the notebooks as

414
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
easy to use Python in the notebooks as well. One of my favorite things about

415
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
well. One of my favorite things about

416
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
well. One of my favorite things about using IDP and data bricks and I've used

417
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
using IDP and data bricks and I've used

418
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
using IDP and data bricks and I've used a lot of tools. I've used a lot of

419
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
a lot of tools. I've used a lot of

420
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
a lot of tools. I've used a lot of processes. One of my favorite things is

421
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
processes. One of my favorite things is

422
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
processes. One of my favorite things is that it's all in one place. This isn't

423
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that it's all in one place. This isn't

424
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that it's all in one place. This isn't some complex pipeline that uses six or

425
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
some complex pipeline that uses six or

426
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
some complex pipeline that uses six or seven different tools. It's all within

427
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
seven different tools. It's all within

428
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
seven different tools. It's all within data bricks. And so you have your raw

429
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
data bricks. And so you have your raw

430
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
data bricks. And so you have your raw data, your raw PDF files sitting in the

431
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
data, your raw PDF files sitting in the

432
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
data, your raw PDF files sitting in the catalog. And then once you process it,

433
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
catalog. And then once you process it,

434
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
catalog. And then once you process it, you're going to have your structured

435
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you're going to have your structured

436
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you're going to have your structured data sitting right next to it. And so

437
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
data sitting right next to it. And so

438
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
data sitting right next to it. And so you have your raw data, you have your

439
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you have your raw data, you have your

440
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you have your raw data, you have your code, and you have your structured

441
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
code, and you have your structured

442
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
code, and you have your structured output all in one place. And so it makes

443
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
output all in one place. And so it makes

444
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
output all in one place. And so it makes it really easy to actually do quality

445
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
it really easy to actually do quality

446
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it really easy to actually do quality checks on your data. And if you've ever

447
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
checks on your data. And if you've ever

448
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
checks on your data. And if you've ever run quality checks on your data before,

449
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
run quality checks on your data before,

450
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
run quality checks on your data before, which you absolutely should be doing,

451
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
which you absolutely should be doing,

452
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
which you absolutely should be doing, when it's all spread out, it's all in

453
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
when it's all spread out, it's all in

454
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
when it's all spread out, it's all in these different systems, it is very,

455
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
these different systems, it is very,

456
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
these different systems, it is very, very tedious. And so actually having it

457
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
very tedious. And so actually having it

458
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
very tedious. And so actually having it all in one place makes it 10 times

459
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
all in one place makes it 10 times

460
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
all in one place makes it 10 times easier. Now in the next several lessons

461
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
easier. Now in the next several lessons

462
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
easier. Now in the next several lessons we're going to be diving into these

463
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
we're going to be diving into these

464
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
we're going to be diving into these functions of parsing, extracting and

465
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
functions of parsing, extracting and

466
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
functions of parsing, extracting and classifying our data. And then at the

467
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
classifying our data. And then at the

468
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
classifying our data. And then at the very end we'll have an end to end

469
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
very end we'll have an end to end

470
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
very end we'll have an end to end process where you can build out an

471
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
process where you can build out an

472
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
process where you can build out an entire process where you have your raw

473
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
entire process where you have your raw

474
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
entire process where you have your raw documents. We're going to process all of

475
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
documents. We're going to process all of

476
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
documents. We're going to process all of them. It could be 50, could be 100

477
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
them. It could be 50, could be 100

478
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
them. It could be 50, could be 100 documents. We're going to process it

479
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
documents. We're going to process it

480
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
documents. We're going to process it into structured data. I'm going to show

481
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
into structured data. I'm going to show

482
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
into structured data. I'm going to show you that it's actually quite easy and

483
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you that it's actually quite easy and

484
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you that it's actually quite easy and extremely accurate. I am a huge data

485
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
extremely accurate. I am a huge data

486
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
extremely accurate. I am a huge data collection nerd. This is like something

487
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
collection nerd. This is like something
