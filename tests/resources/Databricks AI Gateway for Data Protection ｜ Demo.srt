00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,740
Hi, everybody, back to Databricks free edition.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,640
I wanted to show you something really cool with

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,960
the AI gateway when it comes to serving endpoints.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,720
One of my favorite little features actually

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
is when I create a serving endpoint using clicking up here,

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,660
I'll just go to the one that I've already have.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,540
You notice that actually I can edit

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,340
the AI gateway to block PII or ensure safety of the data.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,840
So in other words, when there's data

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,080
like credit card numbers,

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,020
e-mail addresses, UK NI numbers,

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,940
I can actually block that stuff.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,820
So right here, I actually have the safety there, get go.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,180
So let me show you this is in action.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,160
Let me go to click on the playground.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm going to run this, but I'm actually going to run also GPT-5.

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,580
This is with my own key to open AI to use

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,180
GPT-5 mini and try out some really quick queries.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,040
Now, let's start off with zip code.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm going to type that here.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Now, this isn't PII code or anything like that.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,900
So I'm going to go ahead and let that sucker run

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,360
and basically it'll generate some responses.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,520
So it'll kick in and perfect.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
It actually responds appropriately.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,960
Now, in this case, they're actually both wrong.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,660
This one says Renton, this one says Federal Way,

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,600
but it's actually for Kirkland.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,140
But that actually has to do with OpenAI,

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,200
nothing to do with our keys itself.

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
But how about if I go ahead and ask the question

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,760
that actually has personally identified information

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,880
like the UK NI number?

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,580
I chuck in something like this.

35
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,080
You notice the one with guardrails right away,

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,100
it actually prevents you from actually sending

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,180
that particular question.

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,560
So error code, bad request.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,380
This case, you can look through the JSON

40
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,260
and it tells you right away that basically no worries,

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,040
there's no hate, self-harm or any other content,

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,840
but they did notice the potentially PI information.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
And that's what's listed here.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,040
Meanwhile, my mini, it'll actually go ahead

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,460
and send the query to GPT-5 mini and OpenAI,

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,660
and it'll actually go ahead and give me this error,

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,880
which is not bad,

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,200
but it actually is sending the information to GPT-5.

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,840
Now, if you're wondering which one actually

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,120
or how this works, just refer to the instructions.

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,580
Now, notice this, the AI guardrails is in private preview,

52
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,580
but then it'll note right here,

53
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,200
personally identifiable information detection

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,120
is actually using, the AI guardrails is using Presidio.

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,020
And so if you click on this link and it'll show up here,

56
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,860
it'll give you all this cool information

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,140
about which ones are available, which ones accessible,

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,600
like from the USA, bank number, driver's license, UK,

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
includes the national insurance number, which we just sent,

60
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,720
and all these other pieces of information like credit card,

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
which is actually what we're gonna go do next, all right?

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,840
So let me go ahead,

63
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,380
and this is obviously a fake credit card number,

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,820
but let me go ahead and try to write that and send that now.

65
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,460
And then this case, again, the guardrails kicks in

66
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,700
and says, nope, I'm not allowed sending this information in.

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,700
Okay, and right there, you'll notice it says,

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,640
what type of credit do I have?

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,660
I'm gonna have credit for this reason,

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,760
input guardrail triggered, okay?

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
And this one is sending to GPT-5 mini

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,420
without the guardrails.

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,780
GPT-5 actually does go ahead and try to make sense of this.

74
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,660
It'll figure out that it's most likely a Visa card,

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,380
but it actually can't look up additional information.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Now, what's really cool is that with AI guardrails,

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,920
it's actually trying to protect sending the information

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840
directly to your model,

79
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,200
so that way the PI information

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,480
doesn't actually ever leave your Databricks environment.

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
So to prove my point,

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
remember how I showed you back in initially

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
when I showed the endpoints?

84
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Here, let me open this up just for a second, all right?

85
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,920
I have this, I can edit it,

86
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,080
and I can actually have, for example,

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,200
the plain text key, this is the setting.

88
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,380
Okay, I'm gonna cancel that for now, so this is enabled.

89
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,220
To prove my point, I'm gonna go ahead

90
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,620
and actually delete the key that's using, okay?

91
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,120
So I'm gonna revoke that key right now.

92
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Boom, now it's gone.

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm gonna go back to the playground.

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm gonna send this information in, okay?

95
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
Same one, all right?

96
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,940
So let's see what happens.

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,520
Sorry?

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,360
All right, boom.

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
Now, notice that the error messages are different.

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,760
For the one with guardrails, again,

101
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
the bad request is saying

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,220
the input guardrail has been triggered, okay?

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,960
But in the case of GP5 Mini, my key,

104
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,700
it actually is an invalid request

105
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,240
because I just deleted the key.

106
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,840
So that's why I lost my point.

107
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,660
In the case of using guardrails,

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,520
we actually prevent the information

109
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,040
from ever even going to OpenAI in the first place.

110
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,920
So that's really cool.

111
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,500
The guardrails actually really do protect

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,120
and keep that information inside your Databricks environment.

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,060
All right, thanks very much,

114
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,440
and see you at the next AgentBricks demo.

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,400
